      //         Print out this number in the required format.

      // STEP 4: Question - What do you need to change in your Step 3 code
      //                    to find the number of times the *second* word
      //                    appears in the ArrayList?
      //         Question - What about the *third* word?
      //         Question - Do you see a pattern emerging?

      // STEP 5: Turn your code in Step 3 into a loop that checks every word in the ArrayList
